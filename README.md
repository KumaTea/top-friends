Twitter Top Friends

[DEMO](https://top.kmtea.eu)
> Try resize the window!

## Method
Unlike most _Twitter Top Friends_ solutions today, which only count the replies,
this project also counts likes and quote retweets.

`like`:`reply`:`retweet` = `1`:`3`:`5`

And it **only** counts those who you are following.

## Public Service?
I currently don't have such a plan. But... it's open source! You may do it yourself if you want.
